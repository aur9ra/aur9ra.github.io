# Aurora Hart
Hi!

I'm a software developer based out of San Francisco.

Currently, I am working on:
- Chasqui, a feature rich text viewing experience shipped to the browser in <10kB
- muteme, a Discord bot that allows guild administrators to automate basic commands with logging capabilities
- and many other small projects. I build for fun in my free time.

I'm looking for junior level software development work based in San Francisco. You can find my resume [here](resume.html), and contact me at [aurora@aurorah.art](mailto:aurora@aurorah.art).
