Hi!

I'm a software developer based out of San Francisco.

This website is a work in progress. I've thrown up this page with a tool I'm working on that allows for non-technical users to deploy websites with minimal page load times by updating a directory of Markdown files.

I'm looking for junior level software development work based in San Francisco. You can find my resume [here](resume.html), and contact me at [aurora@aurorah.art](mailto:aurora@aurorah.art).
